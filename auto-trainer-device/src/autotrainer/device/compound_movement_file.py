Class to manage compound movement configuration YAML file or YAML dictionary.

In either case, the YAML key for contents is "actions".
It can have 5 subgroups:
* "load_pellet" - a sequence of commands for loading a pellet
* "send_pellet" - a sequence of commands for sending the pellet to the cage
* "cover_pellet" - a sequence of commands for covering the pellet
* "release_pellet" - a sequence of commands for uncovering the pellet
* "move_retract" - a sequence of commands for retracting the pellet
