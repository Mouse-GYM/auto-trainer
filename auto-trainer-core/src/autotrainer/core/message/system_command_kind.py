class SystemCommandKind(IntEnum):
    """
    This class defines the commands supported by the device.  If there is a response beyond acknowledgement, it is
    defined in SystemStatusMessageKind.

    Commands are sent to the device with optional data and context information.  The data is specific to the command
    and may not be applicable to all commands.  The context information is provided by the caller and expected back
    as part of the acknowledgement that the command is complete.  Note that complete may mean that the action is fully
    executed (e.g., a move has reached its final position), not simply that the command was sent to the device.

    The above is currently implemented and represented by the send_message() method in the DeviceConnection class.
