    This class defines the messages types that are sent by the device.  If there is a request/command that generates
    a response, the command will be defined in the SystemCommandKind class.

    A message type is sent to the caller with an optional context/data value.  This value is dependent on the message
    type.

    This is implemented and represented in the send_message() method in the DeviceApi class.
