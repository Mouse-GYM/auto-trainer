    Defines a class with observable property change events.  This is a common pattern for UI frameworks in
    particular where some form of a view layer and some type of model layer need to communicate changes in a decoupled
    way.  However, it is applicable in many other situations as well.

    The property_changed event is used by one or more listeners to respond to property changes.

    _on_property_changed is a convenience method that will only generate an event if the new value does not pass
    the == test with the old value.  This prevents needless events and more importantly endless recursion when two
    objects are listening to each other to stay in sync (e.g., UI and model where a change may originate in either).

        Generate a property-changed event if the new value does not pass the == test with the old value.

        This is a convenience method for only generating an event when the value has actually changed (as defined by
        `==`).  If `==` is not an appropriate test for a given property, a subclass should override this method for
        handling that property, or the caller should use the property_changed event directly.

        A common pattern for subclasses would be:

        ```
        def set_age(self, value: int):
            prev, self._age = self._age, value  # assign the value before call the _on_property_changed event
            self._on_property_changed("age", value, prev)
        ```

        This will only generate an event if the new value is different from the old value and update the member variable
        with the new value if it changed.

        An important note for event handlers is that the property on the object will be the old value at the time the
        event is handled.  Handlers must use the `new_value` argument to get the new value.

        Args:
            name (str): Name of the property that changed.
            new_value: New value of the property.
            old_value: Old/current value of the property.
