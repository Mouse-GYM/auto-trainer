# Autotrainer - Core

This is the base module for functions and objects that used across most or all modules and applications.

Major Elements
* Observable object implementation
* Common Protocols used to bridge different modules
* General pub-sub notification hub implementation
* Event manager for structured application event recording
* Enhanced multiprocessing shared array behavior
* General "project" and animal subject data and management
* Fundamental data analysis operations that may be used ro replay/reprocess data, not just in live capture
* System configuration reading and persistence
* Misc utilities
  * Performance monitoring wrappers
  * Queue extensions

### Future Work
The Project class and functionality is largely geared towards the creation of projects, knowing where to save
data and created those folders and files where necessary.  It should be improved to make it easier to use as 
a reader for tools that need to be aware of those folders and files, but never create them.  This will be used
by the management console to read information without needed to burden the acquisition application directly.

System configuration files have been updated to use YAML tags for typing and with a new structure that better
aligns to the subsystems and their properties.  There is a still a step to separate a) device values that
are unlikely to change over time (e.g., hardware ports), b) values related to application that can change
between sessions, but would not be considered "training" variables and c) training variables that users
are likely to change regularly and in some cases may be changed by hand.
